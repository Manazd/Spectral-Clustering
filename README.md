# Spectral-Clustering
Spectral clustering is a clustering technique that uses the spectrum of the similarity matrix to perform dimensionality reduction before clustering in fewer dimensions. It is a powerful technique that can identify clusters of arbitrary shape and is robust to noise. It is also a popular technique for image segmentation. In this notebook, we will implement spectral clustering from scratch and apply it to graphs and kNN circles.
